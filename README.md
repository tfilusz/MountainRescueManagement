# Web application for mountain rescue operations management.
Now it's simple but working prototype.

I'm going to continuously develop application (add new features) while keeping code as clean as possible and open for further extensions.

# Features:
- CRUD: rescuers and operations
- Many to many rescuer-operation relationship
- Each operation contains 3 rescuers

# Technologies:
- Spring (Boot, MVC, Security)
- Hibernate
- MySQL
- Bootstrap

# TODO:
- security
- further development
