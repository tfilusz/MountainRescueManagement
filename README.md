# Web application for mountain rescue operations management.
Now it's simple but working prototype.

I'm going to continuously develop application (add new features) while keeping code as clean as possible and open for further extensions.

# Features:
- CRUD: rescuers and operations (ManyToMany) + details (OneToOne)
- Custom validation (validating list of Rescuers in Operation objects)
- Security (roles, storing users in database, custom forms)
- Bootstrap views

# Technologies:
- Spring (Boot, MVC, Security)
- Hibernate
- MySQL
- Bootstrap

# TODO:
- deploy on Heroku
- further development
